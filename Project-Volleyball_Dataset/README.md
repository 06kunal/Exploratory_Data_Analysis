# Exploratory Data Analysis on Volleyball Dataset

## Project Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a volleyball dataset using Python. The dataset contains various attributes related to volleyball matches, players, Country, Attack, etc. The goal is to extract insights through data visualization and statistical analysis.

## Files in the Project
- **Volleyball_Dataset_Analysis.ipynb** – The main Python script for data analysis and visualization.
- **VNL2023.csv** – The dataset containing volleyball match and player statistics.

## Libraries Used
The following Python libraries were utilized for data processing and visualization:
- `pandas` – For data manipulation and analysis
- `matplotlib` – For plotting graphs and charts
- `seaborn` – For statistical data visualization

## Data Analysis & Visualization
Various graphical methods were used to understand the dataset:
- **Histogram** – To visualize the distribution of numerical data.
- **Bar Chart** – To compare different categories in the dataset.
- **Pie Chart** – To show proportions of different features.
- **Box Plot** – To analyze the distribution of features.
- **Line Chart** – To observe trends over time.

## Grouping and Aggregation
The `groupby` function was used to analyze different aspects of the dataset, such as:
- Performance of teams and players.
- Trends in match statistics.
- Insights into different features of the dataset.

## How to Run the Project
1. Install required libraries if not already installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```
2. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python Volleyball_Dataset_Analysis.ipynb
   ```

## Results
The project provides insights into volleyball statistics and analyzes different features, and trends, helping to understand key factors affecting game outcomes.
